## Rice Leaf Disease Classification using Resource-Efficient Deep Learning Models via Response-Based Knowledge Distillation

---

### 🌾 **Overview** 🌾

Welcome to the **LiteCNNRice** repository, where we demonstrate an advanced approach to **rice leaf disease classification** using **resource-efficient deep learning models** via **Response-Based Knowledge Distillation (KD)**. This method enables the transfer of knowledge from a complex teacher model to a smaller student model, ensuring both high classification accuracy and a low computational footprint.

> "Empowering precision agriculture through lightweight AI models."

🔍 This repository contains:
- A **lightweight model** trained using KD.
- **Model analysis** and performance evaluation.
- The **dataset** used for training, validation, and testing.

The associated paper titled **"Rice Leaf Disease Classification using Resource-Efficient Deep Learning Models via Response-Based Knowledge Distillation"** outlines the methodology and results.
